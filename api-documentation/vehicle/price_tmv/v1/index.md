<div class="info-message">
 TMV® is the <i>average price</i> that a car sells for within a particular region. TMV® is adjusted for options, the vehicle's color and associated incentives. TMV® figures are <strong>based on the actual sales</strong> of other vehicles of its kind in the given region. The figure is then adjusted further for accuracy using sophisticated calculations designed by mathematicians at Edmunds.com.
</div>

Knowing the TMV® price helps buyers negotiate the price of a new car as well as the value of their trade-in vehicle. Additionally, sellers can use TMV® to set the price of their used car when selling it to a private party.

TMV® is essential information for shoppers because cars sell at very different prices depending on their availability and popularity. Knowing TMV® allows a shopper to make an offer that a dealer will immediately recognize as reasonable. Thus, negotiations will take less time and be more relaxed.
