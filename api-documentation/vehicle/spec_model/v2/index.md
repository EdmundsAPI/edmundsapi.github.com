<div class="info-message">
A vehicle <em>model</em> is specific vehicle brand identified by a name or number (and which is usually further classified by trim or style level). You can get a list of car models for a specific car make and their relevant data via the following endpoints (accessible from the drop-down menu above):
</div>

### Endpoints

* [**Get Details on a Specific Car Model**](/api-documentation/vehicle/spec_model/v2/02_model_details/api-description.html): Returns relevant information Model Year information for a specific car Make and Model. The information can also be narrowed down with filters.

* [**Get a List of Car Models for a Specific Car Make**](/api-documentation/vehicle/spec_model/v2/01_list_of_models/api-description.html): You can get the entire list of car makes or use some basic filters to return the array of car makes you're interested in.

* [**Get Total Count of Models for a Car Make**](/api-documentation/vehicle/spec_model/v2/03_models_count/api-description.html): Get the total number of models of a specific car make. You can use filters to get subtotals (e.g. give me the total number of __new__ models or models available in 1999).

These three endpoints provide all the necessary data points.
