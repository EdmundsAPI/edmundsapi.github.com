#### From Edmunds.com:

*The Edmunds Testing Team evaluates some 200 cars each year. Each vehicle is driven on a standardized road test loop and visits our test track for instrumented testing in controlled conditions. Our time behind the wheel is used to develop ratings that describe how a car stacks up against its direct rivals in a particular size and price class.*
