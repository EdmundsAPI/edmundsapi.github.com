The paint color on the repainted fender does not match the other body panels. Six months after my purchase, Power Volvo of Cerritos still refuses to resolve the issue. In protest, I have exercised my First Amendment rights by launching a website [violative content deleted] to alert consumers on how they treat their customers. Sunit Kakkar, my salesman also made a racist comment against [violative content deleted]. In response to my website, Power Volvo of Cerritos retained attorney [violative content deleted].",
