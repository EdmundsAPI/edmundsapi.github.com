          "description": "Edmunds full test of the redesigned 2013 Honda Accord EX. Includes on-road driving impressions, instrumented test data, specs, photos and more.",
          "introduction": "<p>Honda needs a winner.</p> <p>Between a drift from its traditional engineering-driven principles and the tsunami that devastated its factories, the last four years haven't been kind to the H brand.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the company has redesigned its Accord midsize sedan for the eighth time in its history. It's hardly an overstatement to say that the Accord is both the bread and butter of Honda's lineup, as Americans snatch these babies up at a rate of more than 1,000 per day.</p> <p>The ninth-generation 2013 Honda Accord sedan arrives September 19 with new looks and new bones underneath. Struts replace its traditional double-wishbone front suspension and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) takes the place of a traditional automatic transmission on models with the all-new 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. There's also a revised <a href="/honda/accord/2013/road-test1.html">V6 Accord</a> with an all-new six-speed automatic.</p> <p>In other words, in four-cylinder guise, the new Accord is now virtually identical to every other volume-selling midsize sedan peddled in the U.S.</p> <p><strong>Different. Just Like Everybody Else</strong><br /> Nearly every car in the midsize segment offers a similar-size four-cylinder engine, ample interior space and about the same fuel economy as the new Accord. Progress, it seems, is measured less on fundamentals and more on feature content and styling. And few manufacturers venture far from vanilla when it comes to styling their volume models.</p> <p>Even so, the ever-increasing pressure to deliver miserly fuel consumption is the driving force behind Honda's first-ever direct-injected four-cylinder engine. Rated at 185 horsepower and 181 pound-feet of torque, the new engine comes paired to the six-speed manual transmission as standard, but our EX model has the optional $800 CVT, which replaces the old car's five-speed automatic.</p> <p>The switch to a CVT helps deliver the 2013 Honda Accord's EPA estimated 27 city/36 highway/30 combined mpg ratings, placing it second in the fuel economy race behind the <a href="/nissan/altima/2013/road-test.html" >Nissan Altima</a>. As importantly, the CVT, during around-town driving, performs more intuitively than most we've driven. Its simulated upshifts feel natural and will likely fool all but the most observant drivers into thinking it's a conventional automatic. Wood it getting on the freeway, however, and the unrelenting high-rpm engine howl is present until you lift.</p> <p>Howl as it might, we still recorded 26.3 mpg during 537 miles of combined driving, which handily trumps the 24.1 mpg we recorded over 841 miles in our last test of a 2012 four-cylinder Accord just <a href="/hyundai/sonata/2012/comparison-test.html" >this April</a>.</p> <p><strong>It's Worth It</strong><br /> Honda illustrates the promise of improved acceleration through graphs showing the new Accord to be above and to the right of the old Accord. This, in engineer and PR speak, is universal language for "better."</p> <p>Still, we insist on judging acceleration the old-fashioned way: We measure it. And in this regard there's no argument. It is better. Considerably so.</p> <p>Our 2013 Honda Accord test car whirred its way to 60 mph in 7.8 seconds (7.5 seconds <a href="/car-reviews/features/how-we-test-cars-and-trucks.html">with 1 foot of rollout</a> as on a drag strip). That's a full second better than the old Accord four-cylinder. The quarter-mile, too, is quicker in the new car. The traps whistle past in 15.8 seconds at 91.2 mph, a milestone that required 16.4 seconds in last year's model.</p> <p>During 60-to-0 brake testing, the pedal lacked the confidence we'd prefer, as it softened after multiple stops. The final distance, at 128 feet, was a bit long for the class, as it almost always is with Honda products.</p> <p><strong>Underpinnings</strong><br /> Honda's choice to torpedo the Accord's double-wishbone front suspension in favor of struts seems at first like a poor one for a car proffered as engaging to drive. Double wishbones provide camber control throughout their stroke which generally leads to better handling, although you'd have a hard time selling that line to BMW and Porsche.</p> <p>On the surface, lower cost seems to drive the move, but a full redesign &mdash; especially one as comprehensive as this &mdash; can take years to reap financial benefits. Honda says the decision is driven by weight loss and the need to package a more robust crash structure into the chassis at the upper strut mount.</p> <p>The added strength, say Honda officials, improves performance in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Overlap Barrier Test, where the car is driven into a small fixed object (think pole or tree) just off center at 40 mph. In combination with high-strength steel at critical points, the Accord's unibody is 57 pounds lighter than before and that's without considering the additional savings made by eliminating the old suspension's upper control arm. But at 3,320 pounds, our EX model tipped the scales only 31 pounds lighter than last year's Accord EX tester.</p> <p><strong>It Still Handles</strong><br /> What's more, Honda insists the new suspension hits all its internal handling targets, and after driving it both on the road and through our instrumented tests it's hard to argue otherwise. No midsize sedan is going to engage a dedicated driving enthusiast, but some will certainly repel us. Toyota's Camry LE, for example, is largely successful at this task by demonstrating the dynamic apathy of a sofa bed.</p> <p>The 2013 Honda Accord, however, does not. Its low-effort electrically assisted steering lacks the arbitrary weight of its predecessor but provides ample feel to guide the car prudently between the cones or down a rough back road. Damping, too, is tuned to return genuine body control. As a result we found ourselves hustling the Accord at a respectable pace in places we wouldn't bother with in much of its competition.</p> <p>At 65.5 mph through our slalom, the 2013 Accord was 2.1 mph quicker than the 2012 model, so its ultimate capabilities are clearly improved. It equaled the outgoing car on the skid pad, where both circled at 0.83g, which is at the top of the class.</p> <p><strong>Bucking the Trend</strong><br /> It's a fact common to both the midsize and compact segments that the cars are increasing in size. Bigger and bigger they've grown until, in some cases, they have outsized their larger brethren. This, of course, makes for some uncomfortable positioning. Honda, however, keenly avoided the problem by not offering a car bigger than the Accord (save the <a href="/honda/accord-crosstour/2010/">Accord Crosstour</a>, but who's counting?). And for 2013 it has eliminated the issue altogether by making the new Accord smaller.</p> <p>This Accord sedan is downsized 3.5 inches in overall length and 0.9 inch in wheelbase (to 109.3 inches) yet it gains front and rear headroom. Front legroom remains the same, while rear legroom increases by 1.3 inches. Trunk volume also increases by 0.8 cubic foot.</p> <p>That, friends, is what happens when a company returns to its engineering roots. Inside, this is a big car. Only dimensional deviants will have trouble sitting in the backseat. Even large passengers are comfortable behind a 6-foot driver.</p> <p>What's more, Honda redesigned the Accord's front seats and eliminated the not-quite-low-enough-to-be-lumbar back support that generated complaints during our long-term 2008 Accord test.</p> <p><strong>Interior Attention</strong><br /> Considerable attention was paid to minimizing the button-heavy center stack and simplifying the primary controls. Along with a new one-piece dashboard, the center stack benefits from buttons that divide functions by category. The cleaner interface is both more efficient to use and better-looking.</p> <p>Mercifully, pairing your cellphone via Bluetooth no longer requires voice commands and the necessary manual reading that inevitably accompanies them. An 8-inch screen in the dash accommodates everything from navigation (EX-L models only) to a back-up camera display and is also standard in every Accord. Dual-zone climate control is included on all trims, but you'll still have to tap buttons to set your preferred temperature. Bluetooth and the Pandora music-streaming app are both standard and well integrated for easy use.</p> <p>Another notable standard feature is the Active Noise Control system, which uses the audio system speakers to cancel road noise. We tested it and found that it worked, although it only made our tester as quiet as a Camry. But with interior noise traditionally high in Honda products, this is progress. So is the standard (on EX models and above) keyless start and entry.</p> <p>Another new feature on EX level models and above is the LaneWatch system, which displays the car's blind spot on the in-dash screen. The system is triggered via the right turn signal and its 80-degree view is useful in judging gaps and moving confidently between lanes.</p> <p>Hondalink is Honda's means to support Internet services via your smartphone in a presentation formatted for use in the car. Available only on EX-L level sedans and EX level coupes, the system can do everything from reading your Twitter feed to finding you a new Thai restaurant via Yelp. Again, it's well integrated, so it's actually useful instead of being just another electronic toy that goes unused.</p> <p><strong>A Winner?</strong><br /> Our 2013 Honda Accord EX rang up a $26,195 as-tested price, which is only $200 more than last year's model. It's hard to argue that the additional performance, efficiency and feature content aren't worth the bump in cost.</p> <p>More importantly, this Accord is a Honda again &mdash; a case we've been unable to plead for several models in recent years. Many traditional Honda benefits feature prominently here. Visibility, thanks to a relatively low waistline, is better than in most cars in the segment. Materials and assembly quality appear to be at or above past Honda standards and, to our eyes, it even looks better than the car it replaces.</p> <p>That Honda needs a winner in the new Accord is clear. After our drive, we would say it has one.</p> <p><em>The manufacturer provided Edmunds this vehicle for the purposes of evaluation.</em></p>",

          "description": "Edmunds conducts a full test of the 2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 with Navigation.",
          "introduction": "<p>Honda has finally come up with a four-wheeled analog to the legendary Gold Wing touring bike. What's surprising is that it's the new V6-powered, 2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 sedan.</p> <p>Now in its 38th year of production, the Accord has always been the sort of car you never have to justify to your neighbors and family. Everyone knows it's low-key, high-quality, long-value transportation so you get a nod for being sensible, and that's about it.</p> <p>But this latest V6 Accord isn't the appliance you were expecting. It's the best mix of luxury, comfort, performance, fuel efficiency and unpretentious style that Honda has ever offered &mdash; other than the super-smooth, easygoing Gold Wing.</p> <p><strong>Endearing Anonymity</strong><br /> Rub your eyes until they're raw, spin around until you're totally dizzy and then smear some Vaseline on your corneas. Now go look at a 2012 Accord. That's what our 2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 with Navigation looks like. It's handsome and well-proportioned, but in an anonymous and indistinct way, like any one of Mitt Romney's five sons. And it's only available in colors ranging from dignified and unmemorable to subdued and forgettable.</p> <p>Touch the new Accord, however, and the reassuring heft of the door handles alone announces that this midsize sedan is a step up in quality from the Altima, Camry, Optima and Sonata. Opening the door brings a whoosh like cracking open a new can of vacuum-packed coffee. Nearly every surface in the cabin seems like it came from either corn-fed cows or hand-rubbed petrochemicals, and this isn't even the most elite model: There's a new Touring trim level with LED headlights and adaptive cruise control.</p> <p>The major change in here, at least in EX-L Navi models like ours, is the pair of flat-panel screens stacked up in the center of the dash. The smaller of the two displays is a touchscreen for controlling the media options &mdash; Pandora, Bluetooth audio and SMS text messaging if your smartphone is MAP-enabled &mdash; and it's only found in EX-L and Touring models. It's a slick interface, but the sparkly trim surrounding it looks like it came from the lounge at the Stardust Hotel circa 1982.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the larger top screen displays the standard back-up camera, a passenger-side rearview camera and our EX-L model's navigation system, which has a fresh set of maps for 2013. The nav system still uses a chunky dial-type controller, but it's scaled back to a reasonable size in the 2013 Accord, and like every other control in this car, it's easy to use.</p> <p>That passenger-side camera is a sweet piece of work. Known as LaneWatch, the camera is mounted in the sideview mirror's housing and features a wide-angle lens that significantly extends the driver's field of vision. It can be set to switch on every time the right turn signal is activated or turned on using a button at the end of the turn signal stalk. It's not a very high-resolution camera &mdash; more cell phone than GoPro quality &mdash; but it adds confidence to every lane change. No doubt Ray LaHood has already added it to his wish list of future mandated safety technologies.</p> <p><strong>The Velvet Freight Train</strong><br /> Press the red start button and the 2013 Honda Accord's 3.5-liter V6 whirs to life almost silently. It now makes 278 horsepower, up from 271 hp in 2012. At idle you have to check the tachometer to make sure it's running at all.</p> <p>The shifter for the automatic transmission, which now has six forward gears instead of five, glides down into either "D" for regular driving or "S" for Sport, which keeps the car in the lower four gears longer and locks out 6th altogether.</p> <p>Regrettably, paddle shifters are available only in the Accord Coupe, which goes on sale one month after the sedan. Further, coupe buyers can get the V6 and a six-speed manual gearbox, while the sedan is automatic only. We don't mind, though, because this automatic rips off quick, clean upshifts.</p> <p>Honda has revised the V6 so that, the company claims, the torque production is better down low. That's despite the fact that peak torque is actually down 2 pound-feet from last year's 254 lb-ft at 5,000 rpm to 252 lb-ft at 4,900 rpm now. </p> <p>Toe into the accelerator, though, and the grunt is immediate and immersive. With the traction and stability control systems left on, the big sedan simply punches a hole in the atmosphere with no drama and practically no noise. Switch the nannies off and pedal it a bit, and it delivers you to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds (or 5.7 seconds <a href="/car-reviews/features/how-we-test-cars-and-trucks.html">with 1 foot of rollout</a> as on a drag strip). The quarter-mile goes by in a swift 14.3 seconds at 98.1 mph.</p> <p>Not only are these outstanding numbers for a family sedan, they represent a huge improvement over the <a href="/honda/accord/2008/">previous-generation Accord V6</a> sedan, which took 7.0 seconds to reach 60 and covered the quarter-mile in 15.3 seconds at 95.4 mph. They're also right in line with the V6-equipped <a href="/nissan/altima/2013/road-test.html" >2013 Nissan Altima</a>, which turned in a 6.2-second 0-60 time (5.8 with rollout) and a 14.3-second quarter-mile at 99.8 mph.</p> <p>Along with the new transmission, friction-reduction measures in the engine contribute to the 2013 Honda V6 Accord's lower fuel consumption. It's rated at 21 city/34 highway and 25 mpg combined versus last year's 20 city/30 highway/24 combined. Our test car averaged 28.7 mpg over 191 miles of mostly highway driving; the last time we <a href="/volkswagen/passat/2012/comparison-test.html">tested a V6 Accord</a>, we couldn't do better than 22 mpg. The V6 Altima is rated at 22/31/25, and our best tank during that test was 28.4 mpg.</p> <p><strong>Not So Sticky</strong><br /> The 2013 Honda Accord V6 is quick and its powertrain is perfectly behaved, but it's not a sport sedan. </p> <p>In daily use, the 3,531-pound Accord rides with superb comfort and has more than enough handling ability to see you through gnarly freeway interchanges and grocery store parking lots.</p> <p>But Honda specified its 215/55R17 Michelin Primacy MXV4 all-season tires with low rolling resistance and hushed performance as top priorities. On the skid pad the tires lose all decorum, and the Accord squeals to a modest 0.82g. Performance is also subdued through the slalom, where the Accord musters a 63.5-mph run. These Michelins do the big Honda no favors in the braking department, either. Our test car needed 128 feet to stop from 60 mph &mdash; not a great performance for this class.</p> <p>The steering is among the better electric-assist systems out there, with light effort levels and precise feedback. But this car wasn't built for chasing apexes, and the nose-heavy V6 sedan isn't as well balanced as the <a href="/honda/accord/2013/road-test.html">four-cylinder Accord</a>, which averaged 65.5 mph through the cones. The V6 Altima is the reigning family-car slalom champ, though, with a 66.6-mph run.</p> <p><strong>Four-Wheeled Gold Wing</strong><br /> Ultimately, what the 2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 Navi does best of all is gobble up miles. For the first time, the EX-L V6 sedan isn't just the expensive Accord. It's now a transcontinental, luxury-class cruiser, an adult touring machine. It's a Honda Gold Wing with two extra wheels, automatic climate control and the best fairing ever devised. And at $32,860, this Accord costs only a couple thousand dollars more than the bike.</p> <p>Of course, this ninth-generation Honda Accord still looks like an Accord, so your neighbors won't be jealous. But they should be.</p> <p><em>The manufacturer provided Edmunds this vehicle for the purposes of evaluation.</em></p> ",
