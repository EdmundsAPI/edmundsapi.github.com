###General Guidelines

* Please find the Edmunds Certified Developer Network policies below. If you violate any of the applicable policies, you may be notified by a *warning* email at any time. Those emails will include a compliancy deadline that will depend on the type of violations. Non compliancy in time will result in your removal from the Edmunds Certified Developer Network, or ECD Network, from a *minimum period of 6 months*, after which you may or may not be allowed to re-apply. This will be specified in the notification email.
* Edmunds.com, Inc. reserves the right to grant or remove access to the Platform or ECD Network at its sole discretion.
* Every ECD must provide ECD Team members with login credentials upon request.

###Badge Use Policies

In order to use the badge, you must follow the badge use policies outlined below, as well as adhere to all of our [Terms of Service](http://edmunds.com).

#### ECD badge

The ECD badge allows you to promote your status as an Edmunds Certified Developer in online and offline materials.

#### Using the ECD badge

* You may use the badge only if you have been recognized as a ***Certified Developer*** by the Edmunds.com API Team
* You may only display the badge as is without any modifications once you have been recognized by the API team as having met the requirements for that qualification. If you lose qualification in any area, we will send you a new badge that reflects your updated qualifications.
* In online materials, the badge *must hyperlink* to one of the following: the ECD Network Page, or your profile page in the ECD Network section
* In offline materials, you must include a printed URL to developer.edmunds.com/certified-dev.html immediately adjacent to the badge
* You must keep sufficient space around the badge so it appears clean and uncluttered
* You may not modify or alter the badge in any way, such as changing its design or color, or combining the badge with any other words or images
* Your own brand or personal identity must be the predominant identity whenever the badge is displayed
* You may not use the badge as a profile image or incorporate the badge into any profile image
* You may not use this badge in any way that implies that you are an employee or agent of Edmunds.com, or that Edmunds.com, Inc. is responsible for your services
* You may not use this badge in a way that is deceptive, harmful, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to Edmunds.com, Inc.

These policies are limited to the ECD badge. Edmunds.com’s [Brand Usage Guidelines](/api_branding_guide/), apply to any other use of Edmunds.com logos, trademarks or screenshots. To incorporate Edmunds.com logos, trademarks or screenshots into your materials, you must submit a request for permission via the Permissions Request Form. Edmunds.com reserves the right to terminate or modify your permission to use the badge at any time, at its sole discretion.

###Press Policies

In addition to the below guidelines, the **Edmunds Developer PR Guidelines** must be observed when discussing the program publicly (press releases, articles, blog posts, etc.). Failure to do so may result in retraction of public materials or removal from the program.

You will find the Edmunds Developer PR Guidelines at the bottom of this page. All ECD press releases must be sent to **api@edmunds.com** for review and approval.

#### Beta products

Product discussions with Edmunds.com regarding new or existing products are considered confidential. Developers are not to discuss non-public products or plans unless provided explicit permission from Edmunds.com even if public documentation exists. This includes, but is not limited to, products described as “alpha,” “beta,” and tests.

###Compliance Policies

Edmunds.com’s Certified Developer Network helps developers create products that create effective automotive experiences. To ensure a positive and consistent experience, Edmunds.com has outlined a set of compliance policies that govern users of our APIs. These policies are also used to assess applications for Edmunds.com’s Certified Developer Network program, badges, and directory. 

Please review these policies carefully. Violations may result in suspension from Edmunds.com’s Certified Developer directory, revocation of previously awarded Certified Developer badges, and other sanctions. We reserve the right to request documentation from you to ensure your compliance with this policy.
