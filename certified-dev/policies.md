#### General Guidelines

* Please find the Edmunds Certified Developer Network policies below. If you violate any of the applicable policies, you may be notified by a *warning* email at any time. Those emails will include a compliancy deadline that will depend on the type of violations. Non compliancy in time will result in your removal from the Edmunds Certified Developer Network, or ECD Network, from a *minimum period of 6 months*, after which you may or may not be allowed to re-apply. This will be specified in the notification email.
* Edmunds.com, Inc. reserves the right to grant or remove access to the Platform or ECD Network at its sole discretion.

#### Using the ECD Badge Box

* You may use the ECD Badge Box only if you have been recognized as a ***Certified Developer*** by the Edmunds API Team
* You may only display the ECD Badge Box as-is without any modifications once you have been recognized by the API team as having met the requirements for that qualification. If you lose qualification in any category, we will send you a new ECD Badge Box that reflects your updated qualifications.
* In online materials, the ECD Badge Box *must hyperlink* to one of the following: the ECD Network Page, or your profile page in the ECD Network section
* In offline materials, you must include a printed URL to developer.edmunds.com/certified-dev.html immediately adjacent to the badge
* You must keep sufficient space around the badge box so it appears clean and uncluttered
* You may not modify or alter the ECD Badge Box in any way, such as changing its design or color, or combining the badge with any other words or images
* Your own brand or personal identity must be the predominant identity whenever the ECD Badge Box is displayed
* You may not use the ECD Badge Box as a profile image or incorporate the badge into any profile image
* You may not use this ECD Badge Box in any way that implies that you are an employee or agent of Edmunds.com, or that Edmunds.com is responsible for your services
* You may not use this ECD Badge Box in a way that is deceptive, harmful, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to Edmunds.com, Inc.

#### Compliance Policies

Edmunds.com’s Certified Developer Network helps developers create products that create effective automotive experiences. To ensure a positive and consistent experience, Edmunds.com has outlined a set of compliance policies that govern users of our APIs. These policies are also used to assess applications for Edmunds.com’s Certified Developer Network program, badges, and directory. 

Please review these policies carefully. Violations may result in suspension from Edmunds.com’s Certified Developer directory, revocation of previously awarded Certified Developer badges, and other sanctions. We reserve the right to request documentation from you to ensure your compliance with this policy.
