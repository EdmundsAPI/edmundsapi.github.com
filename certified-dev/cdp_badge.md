All Certified Developers are given an ECD badge per category in which they are deemed proficient by Edmunds.com. Those categories are: web, mobile, social and analytics. The Certified Developers **are not directly endorsed** by Edmunds.com, but have clearly demonstrated unique capabilities that help customers build efficient applications using the Edmunds API.
