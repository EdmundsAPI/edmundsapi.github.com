### The Answers

<span class="question-header" >What is an API?
</span>
[Kin Lane](http://apievangelist.com), who's also known as *API Evangelist*, has the best answer for this question:

> *An API -- Application Programming Interface -- at its most basic level, allows your product or service to talk to other products or services. In this way, an API allows you to open up data and functionality to other developers, to other businesses or even between departments and locations within your company. It is increasingly the way in which companies exchange data, services and complex resources, both internally, externally with partners, and openly with the public.*

We also put together this [3-minute video](http://vimeo.com/65923039) to explain what an API is and how the Edmunds API works.

<span class="question-header" >Why has Edmunds decided to open up the data?
</span>
We here at Edmunds believe strongly that innovation is fostered best through openness and transparency. We’re opening up our data because we want to give you, the developer, the ability to explore its potential beyond what we have already done. You can use the breadth and detail of the automotive information available through the Edmunds’ API to create mashups, mobile apps, visualizations and other data-consuming applications that will provide an added dimension of user experience for the automotive consumer. Edmunds is committed to helping automotive consumers find the car that meets their every need. Providing our data to developers interested in automotive data is a key component to achieving our goal.

<span class="question-header">How might I use the content that's made available via the Edmunds API?
</span>
We want you to be as *creative* and as *innovative* as possible with our data. We have tried hard to put as little constraints on you as possible. The only thing we ask you to do is to **comply with our [Terms of Service](/terms_of_service/)**.

<span class="question-header">How much does it cost to use the API?
</span>
The Edmunds API is **FREE**. Certain resources and datasets that are deemed for **Partners only** will require a discussion with our business development team, but no monetary compensation is expected for the API access.

<span class="question-header">What data formats does the Edmunds API support?

The vast majority of our data is returned in **JSON**. The Editorial API resource support JSON as well as XML. We are trying to add XML support to the other APIs in the future.

<span class="question-header">What happened to the old API calls I was using?</span>
When we launch a new version of an API resource, we remove the documentation for the older version of that resource so new developers don’t start coding against it. The API calls themselves are not removed until the date called out in the docs. We encourage all developers to move over to the new API resources when available since they’re the ones we’ll continue to support.
